= Conversion API 

== Purpose 
Converts legacy TED XML notices into current eForms notices, to facilitate continuity and consistency in data. 

== What It Does

* Transforms legacy TED XML notice formats into "partial" eForms notices, which can then be completed by users. 
* Bridges the gap between legacy systems and the eForms standard that is currently in use. 

== Why This API Exists 
As eForms replaced legacy TED XML notices, the Conversion API simplifies the transition by enabling systems to convert older formats automatically. This ensures compatibility and preserves access to critical procurement data.  

== Endpoint

== Who Uses This API 

* eSenders migrating legacy data to the eForms ecosystem.

* eNotices2 web user interface when users select to import a published TED XML notice to continue a procedure.
