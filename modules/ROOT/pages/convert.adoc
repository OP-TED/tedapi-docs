= Conversion API 

As eForms replaced legacy TED XML notices, the Conversion API simplifies this transition by enabling systems to convert older formats automatically. This ensures compatibility and preserves access to critical procurement data. By converting legacy TED XML notices into current eForms notices, the API facilitates continuity and consistency in managing procurement information.
