== Introduction

The Publications Office (OP) has developed a range of applications for the submission, validation, processing, visualisation and dissemination of https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/public-procurement/digital-procurement/eforms_en[eForms] notices. These went into production on 14 November 2022 and are collectively known as *TED Apps*. 

The OP has also developed *TED API*, a set of programmatic tools that allows third-party developers to integrate their applications with the TED ecosystem and the TED Apps. By using TED API, organisations can automate and streamline processes related to public procurement, enabling efficient interaction with TED services across Europe. This makes it an essential resource for governments, businesses, and developers (e.g. eSenders or reusers of TED Data) who need to work with public procurement notices. 

Using the TED API, developers can create applications that:

 * Retrieve published procurement notices from the TED website for analysis or reuse. 
 * Submit and manage notices for publication programmatically, eliminating manual steps.
 * Validate notices to ensure compliance with procurement regulations.
 * Visualise notices in readable formats such as PDFs or HTML.

TED API allows anonymous access to all services manipulating published notices (i.e. searching for, or retrieving notices already published on TED). All TED API endpoints that manipulate notices which are not yet published, require the \cas\logincaller to be authenticated with an API key.

See section <<API keys>>.

== How TED API connects to TED Apps 

Each TED API operation aligns with specific TED applications, enabling the seamless processing, validation, and publication of eForms notices. The diagram below illustrates how these connections are structured: 

image::api_connections.png[]

 * *eNotices2:* This is the single entry point for submitting and managing eForms notices. It interacts with the *Publication API* to allow programmatic submissions, queries, and publication management. The eNotices2 web user interface was designed with front-end users in mind, whereas applications and developers should interact directly with the Publication API. It also interacts with the *TED Central Validation Service* for validating notices before and upon submission. 

 * *TED Central Validation Service (TED CVS):* This service – which exists only as an API – ensures notices meet compliance standards. The *Validation API* provides a mechanism to check notices for errors and warnings. This service can be used independently at any time to detect and correct errors in notices prior to sending them for publication via the Publication API. Any notice that passes validation through CVS upon submission to the Publication API or the eNotices2 front-end, can be considered technically valid for publication on TED. 
 * *TED Viewer:* Used for rendering notices into readable formats such as HTML and PDF. The *Visualisation API* facilitates this functionality. It also interacts with eNotices2 to preview a notice in PDF or HTML and can be called directly by external parties to preview their XML notices. 
 * *TED Website:* This is the public-facing platform for published notices. The *Search API* enables access to these notices for reuse or analysis. Expert queries built on the TED Website can also be used via the API. 
 * *TED XML Data Converter (TEDXDC):* This service – which exists only as an API – was designed to help with the process of converting a notice published in the legacy TED XML schemas, to a draft form of the same notice in eForms. It is used by eNotices2 when the user imports a published TED XML notice in the interface to continue a procedure in eForms; however, it can also be used as a stand-alone API by developers. 

This interconnected structure ensures that developers can automate every stage of notice processing, from submission to publication and visualisation, while adhering to EU standards. 
Other systems, such as TED Monitor, are internal to the Publications Office and support the preparation of notices for publication. Additionally, auxiliary developer operations provide essential tools for both developers and OP systems. 

== How to get started

. *Obtain an API key*

  * Visit the https://developer.ted.europa.eu/home[TED Developer Portal]. 
  * Log in with your EU Login credentials. 
  * Generate your API Key via the *Manage API Keys* section.

NOTE: Copy and save your API key upon creation; it cannot be retrieved later. 

NOTE: The Search API does not require a key.

[start=2]
. *Authenticate Your Application*

  * Use your API Key in the header of requests to access TED services. 

[start=3]
. *Test in the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms-common/preview/index.html[eForms Preview Environment]*

  * It is important that you refrain from testing in the Production environment. This is reserved for notices that will be published on TED. 
  * For more information, see section <<Testing your apps>>.

== API keys

User authentication and authorisation (for those TED APIs that require it) is controlled by the use of API keys. TED API keys are essentially UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) without hyphens (dashes). 

You can generate and manage your own API keys by logging-in to your account in the link:https://developer.ted.europa.eu[**TED Developer Portal**]footnote:portal[{dev-portal}].

If you use the Publication API, after you generate your key, log into the link:https://enotices2.ted.europa.eu[eNotices2 website] at least once to pair your account and perform at least one valid API request for the system to recognise you as an "eSender".

NOTE: Only one API key is allowed per user. The creation of a new API key implies the automatic revocation of the previous one.


=== API key generation

You can generate an API Key by logging into the TED Developer Portalfootnote:portal[] and clicking on the "Manage your API Keys" button. To login to the TED Developer Portal you will need a valid EU Loginfootnote:eu-login[{eu-login}] account. 

NOTE: For security reasons API keys are not stored and cannot be retrieved via the TED Developer Portal after they are generated. Your API key will be delivered to you only at the time of generation. Copy and safely store the provided API key; if you lose it, you will have to generate a new one.


=== API key life span

Expiry:: Every API key is valid for 24 months. After its validity period elapses, the API key expires. 

Renewal:: 
API key renewal extends the validity of an API key for 12 months. 
+ 
An automated notification will be sent four (4) weeks before the expiration of the API key to the email address associated with the EU-Login account of the user that created the API key. The email will contain a hyperlink that can be used to renew the API key. If you don't click on the hyperlink within 21 days, the link will expire and a new email will be sent to you with a new hyperlink.

Revocation:: You can revoke any unused API keys as needed in the TED Developer Portal. Revoked API keys are invalidated permanently.

== New in TED API v3 

The new TED API v3 simplifies access, consolidates services under a unified gateway, and improves user experience for developers and organisations alike. To address feedback from developers and streamline integration, it introduces a range of improvements:

 * *Unified Gateway:* All APIs are accessible through a single domain: https://api.ted.europa.eu/v3 
 * *Rationalised and standardised API endpoints:* The structure of API URLs has been harmonised: https://api.ted.europa.eu/{api-version}/{resource}/{action}  
 * *Consolidated Swagger Interface:* Explore all endpoints in one place for easier navigation and integration: https://api.ted.europa.eu/webjars/swagger-ui/ 
 * *Streamlined API transitions:* One unified version number for all APIs
 * *Backward Compatibility:* TED API v2 remains active, allowing for a smooth transition to v3



=== Transitioning from TED API v2 

TED API v2 will remain supported for at least six months until July 2025, ensuring a smooth transition to the latest version. 

Developers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version as soon as possible to benefit from its enhanced features and unified interface. 

== Versioning policy 

TED API is committed to providing a stable and reliable environment for developers. Our versioning policy ensures clarity and minimises disruption when introducing updates. 

=== Supported versions 

At any given time, TED API supports two active versions to allow users ample time to transition to the latest version. 

=== Current active versions 

 * Version 2 (Legacy, recommended for migration). 
 * Version 3 (Primary focus, unified and improved features). 

Future transitions will maintain the two-version policy, with older versions being deprecated only after ensuring most users have migrated. 

=== When versions are changed

New versions of TED API are introduced to deliver significant improvements or to address limitations in previous versions. A version change is triggered when:

* New functionalities or services are added that cannot be accommodated within the current version. 
* Technical or compliance requirements necessitate modifications that constitute "breaking changes". 
* A need arises to consolidate or rationalise APIs for better usability. 

The team is committed to providing smooth version transitions by offering extensive support, backwards compatibility, and clear timelines. 

=== Breaking Changes 

We strive to avoid breaking changes within a single version. Breaking changes are defined as changes that can disrupt or require updates to existing integrations. These include: 

 * Removing an endpoint: Users rely on stable access to endpoints for their systems. 
 * Adding a new required request parameter: This introduces incompatibility for existing requests. Adding a new optional parameter is *not* considered a breaking change. 
 * Removing or changing the type of a request parameter or response attribute: This impacts how applications handle data. 

When a breaking change is necessary, a new version will be introduced to preserve compatibility for existing users. We will always provide clear migration guidance and sufficient notice before deprecating an older version. 

== Testing your apps

The https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms-common/preview/index.html[**eForms Preview Environment**] was made available to allow and encourage developers to test their applications before or after deployment.
