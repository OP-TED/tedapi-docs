:eu-login: EU Login is the European Commission's user authentication service. It allows authorised users to access a wide range of Commission web services, using a single email address and password. If you don't have one, you can link:https://ecas.ec.europa.eu/cas/eim/external/register.cgi[create an EU Login account here].

:dev-portal: The link:https://developer.ted.europa.eu[TED Developer Portal] is the single point of access for all TED developers.

= The TED APIs

TED API allows application developers to connect their 3rd party applications to the TED web services. Using TED APIs you can create applications that:

 * Search for and retrieve published notices from the TED Website,
 * Submit new public procurement notices for publication,
 * Validate or render notices.

TED API allows anonymous access to all services manipulating published notices (i.e. searching for, or retrieving notices already published on TED). 

All TED APIs manipulating notices that are not yet published, require the \cas\logincaller to be authenticated with an API key.

CAUTION: Please refrain from testing in the Production environment of eNotices2. This is reserved for notices that will be published in TED. TED Apps for eForms are available in the link:https://docs.ted.europa.eu/home/eforms/preview/index.html[Preview environment] for testing purposes. If you are an eSender, please note that URLs and API keys in "Production" and "Preview" environments are not interchangeable. See section xref:index.adoc#Testing your apps[Testing your apps].

== How TED APIs connect to TED services 

The Publications Office (OP) has developed a range of applications for the submission, validation, processing, visualisation and dissemination of eForms notices, which went into production use on 14 November 2022. TED API serves as the programmatic gateway that connects external systems to these TED services. Each API aligns with specific TED applications, enabling the seamless processing, validation, and publication of eForms notices. The diagram below illustrates how these connections are structured: 

image::api_connections.png[]

 * *eNotices2:* This is the single entry point for submitting and managing eForms notices. It interacts with the Publication API to allow programmatic submissions, queries, and publication management. The eNotices2 web user interface was designed with front-end users in mind, whereas applications and developers should interact directly with the Publication API. It also interacts with the TED Central Validation Service for validating notices before and upon submission. 

 * *TED Central Validation Service (TED CVS):* This service – which exists only as an API – ensures notices meet compliance standards. The Validation API provides a mechanism to check notices for errors and warnings. This service can be used independently at any time to detect and correct errors in notices prior to sending them for publication via the Publication API. Any notice that passes validation through CVS upon submission to the Publication API or the eNotices2 front-end, can be considered technically valid for publication on TED. 
 * *TED Viewer:* Used for rendering notices into readable formats such as HTML and PDF. The Visualisation API facilitates this functionality. It also interacts with eNotices2 to preview a notice in PDF or HTML and can be called directly by external parties to preview their XML notices. 
 * *TED Website:* This is the public-facing platform for published notices. The Search API enables access to these notices for reuse or analysis. Expert queries built on the TED Website can also be used via the API. 
 * *TED XML Data Converter (TEDXDC):* This service – which exists only as an API – was designed to help with the process of converting a notice published in the legacy TED XML schemas, to a draft form of the same notice in eForms. It is used by eNotices2 when the user imports a published TED XML notice in the interface to continue a procedure in eForms; however, it can also be used as a stand-alone API by developers. 

This interconnected structure ensures that developers can automate every stage of notice processing, from submission to publication and visualisation, while adhering to EU standards. 
Other systems, such as TED Monitor, are internal to the Publications Office and support the preparation of notices for publication. Additionally, auxiliary developer operations provide essential tools for both developers and OP systems. 

== How to get started 

. Visit the TED Developer Portal. 
. Log in with your EU Login credentials. 
. Generate your API Key via the *Manage API Keys* section.

NOTE: Copy your API key upon creation; it cannot be retrieved later. 

NOTE: The Search API does not require a key.

== API keys

User authentication and authorisation (for those TED APIs that require it) is controlled with the use of API keys. TED API keys are essentially UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers), without hyphens (dashes). 

You can generate and manage your own API keys by logging-in to your account in the link:https://developer.ted.europa.eu[**TED Developer Portal**]footnote:portal[{dev-portal}].

If you use the the eNotices2 API, after you generate your key, please log into the link:https://enotices2.ted.europa.eu[eNotices2 website] at least once to pair your account.

NOTE: Only one API key is allowed per user. The creation of a new API key implies the automatic revocation of the previous one.


=== API key generation

You can generate an API Key by logging into the TED Developer Portalfootnote:portal[] and clicking on the "Manage your API Keys" button. To login to the TED Developer Portal you will need a valid EU Loginfootnote:eu-login[{eu-login}] account. 

NOTE: For security reasons API keys are not stored and cannot be retrieved via the TED Developer Portal after they are generated. Your API key will be delivered to you only at the time of generation. Copy and safely store the provided API key. If you lose it you will have to generate a new one.


=== API key lifespan

Expiry:: Every API key is valid for 24 months. After its validity period elapses, the API key expires. 

Renewal:: 
API key renewal extends the validity of an API key for 12 months. 
+ 
An automated notification will be sent four (4) weeks before the expiration of the API key to the email address associated with the EU-Login account of the user that created the API key. The email will contain a hyperlink that can be used to renew the API key. If you don't click on the hyperlink within 21 days, the link will expire and a new email will be sent to you with a new hyperlink.

Revocation:: You can revoke any unused API keys as needed in the TED Developer Portal. Revoked API keys are invalidated permanently.

== What is an API? 

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a technical bridge that allows one system to interact with another. Think of it as a way for software applications to "talk" to TED services, enabling systems to exchange information and perform tasks automatically without manual input. 

== Why TED API Exists 

Public procurement is vital for fostering transparency, accountability, and competitiveness across the EU. TED API simplifies and automates interactions with TED services, allowing users to:

 * Retrieve published procurement notices for analysis or reuse. 
 * Submit and manage notices programmatically, eliminating manual steps. 
 * Validate notices to ensure compliance with procurement regulations. 
 * Visualise notices in readable formats such as PDFs or HTML. 

TED API bridges the gap between systems, ensuring efficient and reliable access to TED services. 

TED API is a set of programmatic tools that allows third-party developers to integrate their applications with the TED ecosystem. By using TED API, organisations can automate and streamline processes related to public procurement, enabling efficient interaction with TED services across Europe. This makes TED API an essential resource for governments, businesses, and developers (e.g. eSenders or reusers of TED Data) who need to work with public procurement notices.

== Testing in the Preview Environment 

Use the eForms Preview Environment to test your applications before deployment. To use the eForms Preview Environment you will need an API key generated on the TED Developer Portal of the Preview Environment. This means that you will also need an EU Login account from the EU-Login Acceptance Environment. 

IMPORTANT: If you are using the Publication API, you also need to create an eNotices2 account in the respective environment by logging in with the same EU Login account.  

NOTE: The Search API and the TED Website are not available in the Preview environment; notices submitted in the Preview environment do not get published. 

== Transitioning from TED API v2 

TED API v2 will remain supported for at least six months until July 2025, ensuring a smooth transition to the latest version. 

Developers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version as soon as possible to benefit from its enhanced features and unified interface. 

== Versioning Policy 

TED API is committed to providing a stable and reliable environment for developers. Our versioning policy ensures clarity and minimises disruption when introducing updates. 

=== Supported Versions 

At any given time, TED API supports two active versions. to allow users ample time to transition to the latest version. 

=== Current Active Versions: 

 * Version 2 (Legacy, recommended for migration). 
 * Version 3 (Primary focus, unified and improved features). 

Future transitions will maintain the two-version policy, with older versions being deprecated only after ensuring most users have migrated. 

== When are Versions Changed? 

New versions of TED API are introduced to deliver significant improvements or to address limitations in previous versions. A version change is triggered when: 
New functionalities or services are added that cannot be accommodated within the current version. 
Technical or compliance requirements necessitate modifications that constitute breaking changes. 
A need arises to consolidate or rationalise APIs for better usability. 
We commit to keeping version transitions smooth by offering extensive support, backward compatibility, and clear timelines. 

=== Breaking Changes 

We strive to avoid breaking changes within a single version. Breaking changes are defined as changes that can disrupt or require updates to existing integrations. These include: 

 * Removing an endpoint: Users rely on stable access to endpoints for their systems. 
 * Adding a new required request parameter: This introduces incompatibility for existing requests. Adding a new optional parameter is not considered a breaking change. 
 * Removing or changing the type of a request parameter or response attribute: This impacts how applications handle data. 

When a breaking change is necessary, a new version will be introduced to preserve compatibility for existing users. We will always provide clear migration guidance and sufficient notice before deprecating an older version.
