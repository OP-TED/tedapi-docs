CAUTION: Please refrain from testing in the Production environment of eNotices2. This is reserved for notices that will be published in TED. TED Apps for eForms are available in the link:https://docs.ted.europa.eu/home/eforms/preview/index.html[Preview environment] for testing purposes. If you are an eSender, please note that URLs and API keys in "Production" and "Preview" environments are not interchangeable.



:eu-login: EU Login is the European Commission's user authentication service. It allows authorised users to access a wide range of Commission web services, using a single email address and password. If you don't have one, you can link:https://ecas.ec.europa.eu/cas/eim/external/register.cgi[create an EU Login account here].

:dev-portal: The link:https://developer.ted.europa.eu[TED Developer Portal] is the single point of access for all TED developers.

= TED API Documentation

TED API allows application developers to connect their 3rd party applications to the TED web services. Using TED APIs you can create applications that:

 * Search for and retrieve published notices from the TED Website,
 * Submit new public procurement notices for publication,
 * Validate or render notices.

TED API allows anonymous access to all services manipulating published notices (i.e. searching for, or retrieving notices already published on TED). These APIs are mostly targeted to data reusers. You can find information on reusing TED data at the link:https://simap.ted.europa.eu/en_GB/web/simap/developers-corner#get-published[SIMAP Developers' Corner].

All TED APIs manipulating notices that are not yet published, require the \cas\logincaller to be authenticated with an API key.


== API keys

User authentication and authorisation (for those TED APIs that require it) is controlled with the use of API keys. TED API keys are essentially UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers), without hyphens (dashes). 

You can generate and manage your own API keys by logging-in to your account in the link:https://developer.ted.europa.eu[**TED Developer Portal**]footnote:portal[{dev-portal}].

If you use the the eNotices2 API, after you generate your key, please log into the link:https://enotices2.ted.europa.eu[eNotices2 website] at least once to pair your account.

NOTE: Only one API key is allowed per user. The creation of a new API key implies the automatic revocation of the previous one.


=== API key generation

You can generate an API Key by logging into the TED Developer Portalfootnote:portal[] and clicking on the "Manage your API Keys" button. To login to the TED Developer Portal you will need a valid EU Loginfootnote:eu-login[{eu-login}] account. 

NOTE: For security reasons API keys are not stored and cannot be retrieved via the TED Developer Portal after they are generated. Your API key will be delivered to you only at the time of generation. Copy and safely store the provided API key. If you lose it you will have to generate a new one.


=== API key lifetime

Expiry:: Every API key is valid for 24 months. After its validity period elapses, the API key expires. 

Renewal:: 
API key renewal extends the validity of an API key for 12 months. 
+ 
An automated notification will be sent four (4) weeks before the expiration of the API key to the email address associated with the EU-Login account of the user that created the API key. The email will contain a hyperlink that can be used to renew the API key. If you don't click on the hyperlink within 21 days, the link will expire and a new email will be sent to you with a new hyperlink.

Revocation:: You can revoke any unused API keys as needed in the TED Developer Portal. Revoked API keys are invalidated permanently.

== Welcome to TED API 

TED API is a set of programmatic tools that allows third-party developers to integrate their applications with the TED ecosystem. By using TED API, organisations can automate and streamline processes related to public procurement, enabling efficient interaction with TED services across Europe. This makes TED API an essential resource for governments, businesses, and developers (e.g. eSenders or reusers of TED Data) who need to work with public procurement notices. 

== What is an API? 

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a technical bridge that allows one system to interact with another. Think of it as a way for software applications to "talk" to TED services, enabling systems to exchange information and perform tasks automatically without manual input. 

== Why TED API Exists 

Public procurement is vital for fostering transparency, accountability, and competitiveness across the EU. TED API simplifies and automates interactions with TED services, allowing users to: 
 * Retrieve published procurement notices for analysis or reuse. 
 * Submit and manage notices programmatically, eliminating manual steps. 
 * Validate notices to ensure compliance with procurement regulations. 
 * Visualise notices in readable formats such as PDFs or HTML. 
TED API bridges the gap between systems, ensuring efficient and reliable access to TED services. 
 
== How TED API Connects to TED services 

The Publications Office (OP) has developed a range of applications for the submission, validation, processing, visualisation and dissemination of eForms notices, which went into production use on 14 November 2022. TED API serves as the programmatic gateway that connects external systems to these TED services. Each API aligns with specific TED applications, enabling the seamless processing, validation, and publication of eForms notices. The diagram below illustrates how these connections are structured: 
 
 * eNotices2: This is the single entry point for submitting and managing eForms notices. It interacts with the Publication API to allow programmatic submissions, queries, and publication management. The eNotices2 web user interface was designed with front-end users in mind, whereas applications and developers should interact directly with the Publication API. It also interacts with the TED Central Validation Service for validating notices before and upon submission. 
 * TED Central Validation Service (TED CVS): This service – which exists only as an API – ensures notices meet compliance standards. The Validation API provides a mechanism to check notices for errors and warnings. This service can be used independently at any time to detect and correct errors in notices prior to sending them for publication via the Publication API. Any notice that passes validation through CVS upon submission to the Publication API or the eNotices2 front-end, can be considered technically valid for publication on TED. 
 * TED Viewer: Used for rendering notices into readable formats such as HTML and PDF. The Visualisation API facilitates this functionality. It also interacts with eNotices2 to preview a notice in PDF or HTML and can be called directly by external parties to preview their XML notices. 
 * TED Website: This is the public-facing platform for published notices. The Search API enables access to these notices for reuse or analysis. Expert queries built on the TED Website can also be used via the API. 
 * TED XML Data Converter (TEDXDC): This service – which exists only as an API – was designed to help with the process of converting a notice published in the legacy TED XML schemas, to a draft form of the same notice in eForms. It is used by eNotices2 when the user imports a published TED XML notice in the interface to continue a procedure in eForms; however, it can also be used as a stand-alone API by developers. 
This interconnected structure ensures that developers can automate every stage of notice processing, from submission to publication and visualisation, while adhering to EU standards. 
Other systems, such as TED Monitor, are internal to the Publications Office and support the preparation of notices for publication. Additionally, auxiliary developer operations provide essential tools for both developers and OP systems. 
 
 
== What’s New in TED API v3? 

The new TED API v3 simplifies access, consolidates services under a unified gateway, and improves user experience for developers and organisations alike. 
TED API v3 introduces a range of improvements to address feedback from developers and streamline integration: 
 * Unified Gateway: All APIs are accessible through a single domain: https://api.ted.europa.eu/v3. 
 * Rationalised and standardised API endpoints: The structure of API URLs has been harmonised:  
o https://api.ted.europa.eu/{api-version}/{resource}/{action}  
 * Consolidated Swagger Interface: Explore all endpoints in one place for easier navigation and integration. 
o https://api.ted.europa.eu/webjars/swagger-ui/ 
 * Streamlined API transitions: One unified version number for all APIs. 
 * Backward Compatibility: TED API v2 remains active, allowing for a smooth transition to v3. 




== Available APIs

You can find below the Swagger pages documenting the TED API endpoints that are currently available in production:

== Testing your apps
An **eForms Preview Environment** is available to allow and encourage developers to test their applications. You can find more xref:home:eforms:preview/index.adoc[details on the eForms Preview Environment here].

CAUTION: To use the eForms Preview Environment you will need an API key generated using the link:https://developer.preview.ted.europa.eu/home[TED Developer Portal of the Preview Environment]. This means that you will also need an EU Login account from the link:https://ecas.acceptance.ec.europa.eu/cas/login[EU-Login Acceptance Environment].

NOTE: Information about eSentool, the legacy API to submit and manage notices, is available on the link:https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/TEDeSender[legacy eSenders Wiki].

== Status & Roadmap

The TED API endpoints currently available are the first generation of APIs for the new TED web services for eForms. 

These APIs have been initially released in June 2022 together with the "eForms Preview Environment" and have since remained unchanged. These endpoints will also remain unchanged throughout their lifetime. 

We are currently in the process of simplifying, better documenting and rationalising our APIs to improve user experience and to allow us to keep enriching them in the future for offering better and consistent services to our developer community. 

A second generation of TED APIs is being developed. The release of this second version of TED APIs (which will be known as TED API v2) will be added next to the currently available endpoints and will not replace them. This will allow 3rd party applications that already use the current endpoints to continue functioning **undisrupted**. The current endpoints will only be discontinued when no 3rd party applications use them any more.
