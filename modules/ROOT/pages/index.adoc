:eu-login: EU Login is the European Commission's user authentication service. It allows authorised users to access a wide range of Commission web services, using a single email address and password. If you don't have one, you can link:https://ecas.ec.europa.eu/cas/eim/external/register.cgi[create an EU Login account here].

:dev-portal: The link:https://developer.ted.europa.eu[TED Developer Portal] is the single point of access for all TED developers.

== Introduction

The Publications Office (OP) has developed a range of applications for the submission, validation, processing, visualisation, and dissemination of https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/public-procurement/digital-procurement/eforms_en[eForms] notices. These went into production on 14 November 2022 and are collectively known as *TED Apps*.

The OP has also developed *TED API*, a set of programmatic tools that allows third-party developers to integrate their applications with the TED ecosystem and the TED Apps. By using TED API, organisations can automate and streamline processes related to public procurement, enabling efficient interaction with TED services across Europe. This makes it an essential resource for governments, businesses, and developers (e.g. eSenders or reusers of TED Data) who need to work with public procurement notices.

Using the TED API, developers can create applications that:

* **Retrieve** published procurement notices from the TED website for analysis or reuse.

* **Submit and Manage** notices for publication programmatically, eliminating manual steps.

* **Validate** notices to ensure compliance with procurement regulations.

* **Visualise** notices in readable formats such as PDFs or HTML.

TED API allows anonymous access to all services manipulating published notices (i.e., searching for or retrieving notices already published on TED). All TED API endpoints that manipulate notices which are not yet published require the \cas\logincaller to be authenticated with an API key.

== Getting started

. Obtain an API key
* [ ] Visit the https://developer.ted.europa.eu/home[**TED Developer Portal**].
* [ ] Log in with your **EU Login** credentials.
* [ ] Generate your API Key via the *Manage API Keys* section.

NOTE: Copy and save your API key upon creation; it cannot be retrieved later.

NOTE: The Search API does not require a key.

[start=2]
. Authenticate Your Application
* [ ] Use your API Key in the header of requests to access TED services.

. Test in the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms-common/preview/index.html[eForms Preview Environment]
* [ ] Do not test in the Production environment, as it is reserved for notices that will be published on TED.
* [ ] For more information, see section <<Testing your apps>>.

IMPORTANT: eSenders and developers can create multiple accounts in the Preview environment for testing. In the Production environment, only one account and one API key per EU Login are allowed. We strongly recommend using a shared or functional email address for setting up Production accounts instead of a personal email.

More information on API key management can be found xref:api.adoc[here]

== How TED API links to TED Apps 

Each TED API operation aligns with specific TED applications, enabling the seamless processing, validation, and publication of eForms notices. The diagram below illustrates how these connections are structured:

image::api_connections.png[]

* **eNotices2:**  
  The single entry point for submitting and managing eForms notices.  
  - Interacts with the *Publication API* for programmatic submissions, queries, and publication management.  
  - Designed with front-end users in mind, while developers interface directly with the Publication API.  
  - Works with the *TED Central Validation Service* to validate notices before and upon submission.

* **TED Central Validation Service (TED CVS):**  
  An API-only service ensuring compliance standards for notices.  
  - The *Validation API* checks notices for errors and warnings when they are submitted to the Publication API.
  - Can be used independently to detect errors and warnings at any time before publication.  
  - Notices that successfully pass CVS validation can be considered technically valid for publication on TED.

* **TED Viewer:**  
  Renders notices into readable formats like HTML and PDF.  
  - The *Visualisation API* enables this functionality.  
  - Works with eNotices2 to preview notices in PDF or HTML. 
  - Can be called directly by external parties to preview XML notices.

* **TED Website:**  
  The public-facing platform for published notices.  
  - The *Search API* allows access to these notices for reuse or analysis.  
  - Expert queries built on the TED Website can also be used via the API.

* **TED XML Data Converter (TEDXDC):**  
  An API-only service designed to convert legacy TED XML schema notices into drafts in eForms.  
  - Utilised by eNotices2 when importing a TED XML notice to continue procedures in eForms.
  - Available as a stand-alone API for developers.

This interconnected structure ensures developers can automate the entire notice processing lifecycle—submission to publication and visualisation—while adhering to EU standards.

Other systems, like TED Monitor, are internal to the Publications Office and support the preparation of procurement notices for publication. Additionally, auxiliary developer operations provide essential tools for both developers and OP systems.

== New in TED API v3 

The new TED API v3 introduces several enhancements designed to simplify access, consolidate services, and improve user experience for developers and organisations. Key improvements include:

* **Unified Gateway** 
+
  All APIs are now accessible through a single domain:  
  https://api.ted.europa.eu/

* **Rationalised and Standardised API Endpoints** 
+
  The structure of API URLs has been harmonised for consistency:  
  https://api.ted.europa.eu/{api-version}/{resource}/{action}

* **Consolidated Swagger Interface** 
+
  Explore all endpoints in one place for easier navigation and integration:  
  https://api.ted.europa.eu/swagger

* **Streamlined API Transitions** 
+
  One unified version number for all APIs

* **Backward Compatibility** 
+
  TED API v2 remains active, allowing for a smooth transition to v3


=== Transitioning from TED API v2 

TED API v2 will remain supported for at least six months, until the end of September 2025, ensuring a smooth transition to the latest version. 

Developers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version as soon as possible to benefit from its enhanced features and unified interface.

== Testing your apps

The https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms-common/preview/index.html[**eForms Preview Environment**] was made available to allow and encourage developers to test their applications before or after deployment. Here is how to get started:

=== How to get started

. Obtain an API key
* [ ] Create an EU Login account in the https://ecas.acceptance.ec.europa.eu/cas/login[EU-Login Acceptance Environment].
* [ ] Generate an API key on the https://developer.preview.ted.europa.eu/home[TED Developer Portal of the Preview Environment] via the *Manage API Keys* section.

NOTE: Copy and save your API key upon creation; it cannot be retrieved later.

NOTE: Accounts and API keys in "Production" and "Preview" environments are not interchangeable.

[start=2]
. Authenticate Your Application
* [ ] Use your API Key in the header of requests to access TED services.

IMPORTANT: If you are using the Publication API, you also need to create an account in https://enotices2.preview.ted.europa.eu/home[eNotices2 in the Preview environment] by logging in with the same EU Login account and perform at least one valid API request for the system to recognize you as an "eSender".

NOTE: The Search API and the TED Website are not available in the Preview environment; notices submitted in the Preview environment do not get published.
