== Introduction

The Publications Office (OP) has developed a range of applications for the submission, validation, processing, visualisation, and dissemination of https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/public-procurement/digital-procurement/eforms_en[eForms] notices. These went into production on 14 November 2022 and are collectively known as *TED Apps*.

The OP has also developed *TED API*, a set of programmatic tools that allows third-party developers to integrate their applications with the TED ecosystem and the TED Apps. By using TED API, organisations can automate and streamline processes related to public procurement, enabling efficient interaction with TED services across Europe. This makes it an essential resource for governments, businesses, and developers (e.g. eSenders or reusers of TED Data) who need to work with public procurement notices.

Using the TED API, developers can create applications that:

* **Retrieve** published procurement notices from the TED website for analysis or reuse.

* **Submit and Manage** notices for publication programmatically, eliminating manual steps.

* **Validate** notices to ensure compliance with procurement regulations.

* **Visualise** notices in readable formats such as PDFs or HTML.

TED API allows anonymous access to all services manipulating published notices (i.e., searching for or retrieving notices already published on TED). All TED API endpoints that manipulate notices which are not yet published require the \cas\logincaller to be authenticated with an API key.

See section <<API keys>>.

== How TED API links to TED Apps 

Each TED API operation aligns with specific TED applications, enabling the seamless processing, validation, and publication of eForms notices. The diagram below illustrates how these connections are structured:

image::api_connections.png[]

* **eNotices2:**  
  The single entry point for submitting and managing eForms notices.  
  - Interacts with the *Publication API* for programmatic submissions, queries, and publication management.  
  - Designed with front-end users in mind, while developers interface directly with the Publication API.  
  - Works with the *TED Central Validation Service* to validate notices before and upon submission.

* **TED Central Validation Service (TED CVS):**  
  An API-only service ensuring compliance standards for notices.  
  - The *Validation API* checks notices for errors and warnings when they are submitted to the Publication API.
  - Can be used independently to detect errors and warnings at any time before publication.  
  - Notices that successfully pass CVS validation can be considered technically valid for publication on TED.

* **TED Viewer:**  
  Renders notices into readable formats like HTML and PDF.  
  - The *Visualisation API* enables this functionality.  
  - Works with eNotices2 to preview notices in PDF or HTML. 
  - Can be called directly by external parties to preview XML notices.

* **TED Website:**  
  The public-facing platform for published notices.  
  - The *Search API* allows access to these notices for reuse or analysis.  
  - Expert queries built on the TED Website can also be used via the API.

* **TED XML Data Converter (TEDXDC):**  
  An API-only service designed to convert legacy TED XML schema notices into drafts in eForms.  
  - Utilised by eNotices2 when importing a TED XML notice to continue procedures in eForms.
  - Available as a stand-alone API for developers.

This interconnected structure ensures developers can automate the entire notice processing lifecycle—submission to publication and visualisation—while adhering to EU standards.

Other systems, like TED Monitor, are internal to the Publications Office and support the preparation of procurement notices for publication. Additionally, auxiliary developer operations provide essential tools for both developers and OP systems.


== How to get started

. Obtain an API key
* [ ] Visit the https://developer.ted.europa.eu/home[**TED Developer Portal**].
* [ ] Log in with your **EU Login** credentials.
* [ ] Generate your API Key via the *Manage API Keys* section.

NOTE: Copy and save your API key upon creation; it cannot be retrieved later.

NOTE: The Search API does not require a key.

[start=2]
. Authenticate Your Application
* [ ] Use your API Key in the header of requests to access TED services.

. Test in the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms-common/preview/index.html[eForms Preview Environment]
* [ ] Do not test in the Production environment, as it is reserved for notices that will be published on TED.
* [ ] For more information, see section <<Testing your apps>>.

IMPORTANT: eSenders and developers can create multiple accounts in the Preview environment for testing. In the Production environment, only one account and one API key per EU Login are allowed. We strongly recommend using a shared or functional email address for setting up Production accounts instead of a personal email.


== API keys

User authentication and authorisation (for those TED APIs that require it) is controlled by the use of API keys. TED API keys are essentially UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) without hyphens (dashes). 

You can generate and manage your own API keys by logging-in to your account in the link:https://developer.ted.europa.eu[**TED Developer Portal**]footnote:portal[{dev-portal}].

If you use the Publication API, after you generate your key, log into the link:https://enotices2.ted.europa.eu[eNotices2 website] at least once to pair your account and perform at least one valid API request for the system to recognise you as an "eSender".

NOTE: Only one API key is allowed per user. The creation of a new API key implies the automatic revocation of the previous one.



=== API key generation

You can generate an API Key by logging into the TED Developer Portalfootnote:portal[] and clicking on the "Manage your API Keys" button. To login to the TED Developer Portal you will need a valid EU Loginfootnote:eu-login[{eu-login}] account. 

NOTE: For security reasons API keys are not stored and cannot be retrieved via the TED Developer Portal after they are generated. Your API key will be delivered to you only at the time of generation. Copy and safely store the provided API key; if you lose it, you will have to generate a new one.


=== API key life span


* **Expiry:**
  - Every API key is valid for 24 months.
  - After its validity period elapses, the API key expires.

* **Renewal:**
  - API key renewal extends the validity of an API key for 12 months.
  - An automated notification will be sent four (4) weeks before expiration to the email associated with the EU-Login account used to create the API key.
  - The email contains a hyperlink for renewing the API key. If not clicked within 21 days, the link expires, and a new email will be sent with a fresh hyperlink.

* **Revocation:**
  - You can revoke any unused API keys as needed in the TED Developer Portal.
  - Revoked API keys are invalidated permanently.
