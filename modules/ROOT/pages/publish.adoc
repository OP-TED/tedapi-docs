= Publication API  

== Purpose 
Manage the publication steps of procurement notices programmatically, connecting with the eNotices2 system for seamless integration.

== What It Does 
* Allows programmatic submission of notices for publication.  
* Stops publication of notices that have been successfully submitted but not yet published. 
* Retrieves the validation reports of one’s own submitted notices. 
* Enables querying of one’s own submitted notices allowing synchronisation of the notice metadata, e.g. a notice status during the publication process. 

== Why This API Exists
The Publication API automates the handling of procurement notices, reducing reliance on manual processes. It empowers eSenders and public authorities to manage notices efficiently at scale.
